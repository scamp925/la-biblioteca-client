## Project Overview
Welcome to my full stack capstone project for Nashville Software School!!

La Biblioteca is my version of one of my favorite websites, GoodReads. I enjoy so much about GoodReads, but, for me, there's one thing missing: the ability to rate finished books with full and half star ratings. For La Biblioteca users, the restraint of only rating books with full stars is gone, because let's be honest, some books are 4.5 stars and not 5 stars nor are they 4 stars. Now, fair ratings are giving AND La Biblioteca users still enjoy GoodReads features like placing books onto "Want to Read", "Currently Reading", and "Read" shelves, leaving a review of a read book, perusing other user's reviews, reacting to reviews and using the search bar to find either a book or an author.

My Books

* Using the same Next.js dynamic route file to display individual shelves. Within the file, I wrote condition logic to determine what will be displayed depending on information from how the user is interacting with the UI specifically a dropdown in the navbar.
* All books marked "Want to Read" by user will render on a single page
* All books marked "Currently Reading" by user will render on a single page

## Try La Biblioteca Out
*You've found my client side repo. Yahoo! You can check out my server side repo [here](https://github.com/scamp925/la-biblioteca-server). **In order for the client side to work, you need to have the server side running on your local machine.** Instructions on how to get the backend on your local machine can be found in the repo's ReadMe.*

### How to run frontend locally and setup Firebase authentication

1. Set up a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project - Here's how: [Firebase Setup & Authentication](https://www.loom.com/share/163ffe1539bb482196efa713ed6231e9)

2. Clone La Biblioteca Client to your local machine
``` bash
git@github.com:scamp925/la-biblioteca-client.git
```

3. Move into directory
``` bash
cd la-biblioteca-client
```

4. Once in La Biblioteca's code, create a .env file at the root of the project. Place the following properties into the file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
```

5. The last portion of the Firebase walkthrough from step 1 highlights where to find the values to put in the empty strings in the code snippet of step 4. From Firebase, copy the values and paste them into the empty strings of the respective keys located in the .env file.

6. While in the root directory and from your command line, run
``` bash
npm install or npm i
```
7. Now from your command line, run
``` bash
npm run prepare
```
8. To start La Biblioteca, run
``` bash
npm run dev
```

9. Click http://localhost:3000 in the terminal to open the browser
