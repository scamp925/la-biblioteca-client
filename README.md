#### 3. Clone your new repo to your local machine
#### 4. Go to the **NEXT** section

## Starting the Project
1. Create a Firebase project and set up authentication. Use [these videos](https://vimeo.com/showcase/codetracker-firebase) as a refresher if needed.
1. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project
1. Copy/Paste the contents of the `.env.sample` file to your newly created `.env` file.
1. Copy over all of your Firebase values into the `.env` file.
1. Open the `package.json` file and change the `name` property to the name of your application, and `author` to  your name.
1. From your command line, be in the root directory and run `npm install` OR `npm i` for short.
1. Next, run `npm run prepare`. This command sets up husky to track eslint errors on commit that will make your deploy fail on Netlify.
1. To start your application, run `npm run dev`. THIS IS THE COMMAND YOU WILL USE TO RUN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER FROM NOW ON.
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

### If you see this, you are set to go!

## Project Overview
Welcome to my full stack capstone project for Nashville Software School!!

La Biblioteca is my version of one of my favorite websites, GoodReads. I enjoy so much about GoodReads, but, for me, there's one thing missing: the ability to rate finished books with full and half star ratings. For La Biblioteca users, the restraint of only rating books with full stars is gone, because let's be honest, some books are 4.5 stars and not 5 stars nor are they 4 stars. Now, fair ratings are giving AND La Biblioteca users still enjoy GoodReads features like placing books onto "Want to Read", "Currently Reading", and "Read" shelves, leaving a review of a read book, perusing other user's reviews, reacting to reviews and using the search bar to find either a book or an author.
